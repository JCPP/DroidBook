One thing 
I don't know why

I designed this rhyme 
To explain in due time 
All I know 
Time is a valuable thing 
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings 
Watch it count down to the end of the day 
The clock ticks life away 

It's so unreal 
Didn't look out below 
Watch the time go right out the window 
Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know 
Wasted it all just to watch you go 
I kept everything inside 
And even though I tried, it all fell apart 
What it meant to me 
Will eventually be a memory of a time when

I designed this rhyme 
To remind myself how 
I tried so hard 
In spite of the way you were mocking me 
Acting like I was part of your property 
Remembering all the times you fought with me 
I'm surprised it got so far 
Things aren't the way they were before 
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore 
Not that you knew me back then 
But it all comes back to me in the end 
You kept everything inside 
And even though I tried, it all fell apart 
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when
